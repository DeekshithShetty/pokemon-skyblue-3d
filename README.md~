# Pokemon SkyBlue 3D Version
Pokemon is a media franchise owned by ‘Pokemon Company’. It is centered on fictional creatures called “Pokemon” which stands for pocket monsters, which humans capture and train to fight each other for sport. 
The simulation starts with Ash(The Challenger) and Pikachu reaching the battle stadium where Gary(The Champion) stands to face the challenger. The outside scene includes trees, grass and buildings thereby giving a realistic effect of the nature. On entering the stadium we can go to battle screen showing various attacks of pokemons.
This simulation provides a third person camera view, allowing the main characters (Ash and Pikachu) to be able to move in all direction by rotating the camera through keyboard controls. 
This simulation helps Pokemon/RPG Game fans to play this Nintendo game on PC which otherwise could have only been able to be played through a Game Boy console.
This project runs on Linux Operating System.
